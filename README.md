Summary
Provides interactive learning of programming foundations and Java, with hundreds of embedded learning questions, animations, tools, and web-based programming practice. Replaces textbooks. Includes auto-graded homework. In addition to basic programming constructs (branches, loops, methods), the zyBook includes coverage of ArrayLists, Java Collections Framework, UML, GUIs, and basic graphics. Furthermore, the material includes emphasis on disciplined program development, including incremental development, modular development, and testing/debugging.


The zyBook especially emphasizes a solid understanding of memory. From the moment variables are introduced, the material shows via animations how variables exist and are updated in memory. The continued showing of memory helps clarify challenging topics like pass-by-copy/reference parameters, object creation, garbage collection, and more.
